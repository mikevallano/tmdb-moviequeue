This Rails app solves a few problems:
1. You can create lists of movies that they want to watch. No more wasting precious movie-watching time with movie-finding time. No more stale popcorn.
2. You can track movies they've seen. You may wish to forget that you've watched Sharknado, but the data doesn't lie (you can also rate it and prioritize it so you don't have to suffer through it again).
3. You can share a list with someone you watch lots of movies with. Members of the list can add or remove movies from lists, and members can see each other's tags. Movies are better watched together.
4. Is that the guy from that one movie?

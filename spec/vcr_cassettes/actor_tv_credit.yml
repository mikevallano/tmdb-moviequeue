        has shown off his \"flawless pearls,\" which results in him being taken the
        hospital, where a lack of insurance card keeps him prisoner. Homer has the
        insurance card, but is nowhere to be found. As a solution, Homer gets a mobile
        phone and a few extra unnecessary accessories, which only leads to him not
        paying attention to where he is driving. That is until it is much too late
        and he drives off of a pier. Judge Harm takes his license away and Homer is
        no longer able to drive. Marge picks up the slack and starts becoming \"Stresserella.\"
        Homer walks to Moe''s, but much to Moe''s dismay he decide to keep on walking
        and starts getting healthy. Homer walks to work and is the only employee to
        arrive, everyone else is caught in a traffic jam. Marge is frazzled from all
        her driving, meanwhile Homer sings and walks about the virtues of walking
        when he is stuck by a car; the driver of the car was Marge. Marge, who cares
        so much for Homer, tries to help in his recovery, but Homer perceives that
        she might be trying to kill him. It leads to fight, which in turn leads them
        to see a marriage counselor. After Marge leaves, the counselor suggests that
        Homer perform one unselfish act of love to win Marge back, in other words
        take her to dinner. Homer decides to one up that suggestion and invites everyone
        in Springfield (except the Flanders family) to a backyard barbeque in Marge''s
        honor. Homer joins Jackson Browne in a duet to sing his praises of Marge.","season_number":14,"still_path":"/AlYJsfGR68g3DrTcTC0XwbuAcvz.jpg"},{"air_date":"2007-10-14","episode_number":4,"name":"I
